# turing-machine-simulator
This program creates a Turing machine using the provided transition functions and allows users to check strings for membership in the language recognized by the Turing machine.

## Overview
A Python-based Turing machine simulator that enables users to define transition functions for a Turing machine. The program creates a Turing machine using the provided transition functions and allows users to check strings for membership in the language recognized by the Turing machine. The simulator includes an interactive interface for inputting transition functions and validating strings, making it a versatile tool for exploring and experimenting with Turing machines.

## Features
- Define Turing machine transition functions.
- Create a Turing machine using the specified transition functions.
- Check strings for membership in the Turing machine's language.

## Usage
- User inputs transition functions in a certain format.

- User can input a string and program checks its membership in Turing machineafter.
  If the language is approved, the admission procedures must be displayed in a this format:
